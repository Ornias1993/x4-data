	<h2>Argon</h2>
	
	<br>

		<img src="/x2/help/images/logo_argon.gif" style="float: left; padding-right: 4px;" alt="Argon">

             The Argon people are believed to be the descends of that of the Earth people, many years 
             ago. Many years ago the AP Sorja 44 (AP Gunner) crashed landed, ever since the Argon 
             have been battling the Xenon. A fews ago years a ship believed to be from Earth piloted 
             by the captain Brennan, jumped across the galaxy without the use of a jumpgate. Many 
             Argon's dont belive Brennan was from earth, however he helped in the final battle 
             against the Xenon and then built the company Teracorp to fund his research on going back 
             to Earth and into drive technology, this is where the jumpdrive comes from.
             <br><br>
             Argon ships very reversible but not being good or bad at anything.

	<h2>Boron</h2>
	
	<br>

		<img src="/x2/help/images/logo_boron.gif" style="float: left; padding-right: 4px;" alt="Boron">
             The Boron are a friendly species who live primarily under the sea. Their ships must be 
             able to travel under the sea and also into space where awaiting factories supply them 
             with resources. The Boron consider everyone an friend and will not attack automatically.
             <br><br>
             Teracorp are working with the Boron creature named Mi-Ton to create a drive which will 
             work under and in space on other ships than that of the Boron.

	<h2>Paranid</h2>
	
	<br>

		<img src="/x2/help/images/logo_paranid.gif" style="float: left; padding-right: 4px;" alt="Paranid">

             The correctly called Paranid, are simply paranoid of everyone including their own race. 
             In order even to dock with one of their stations pilots have to show good will to them.
             <br><br>
             Paranid are known for their advance technology however the same cant be said about thier 
             hospitality.
             <br><br>
             Paranid ships are fast, powerful and deadly, and even cheap in the case of the Paranid 
             Hercules (TL).

	<h2>Pirates</h2>
	
	<br>

		<img src="/x2/help/images/logo_pirates.gif" style="float: left; padding-right: 4px;" alt="Pirates">
             The Pirates are made of all the other species who don't want to conform to that of the 
             'standard' way of doing things. The Pirates are believed that their ships are created 
             by the Teladi, were the Orinoco (M3) have an similar design of the Teladi Falcon (M3).
             <br><br>
             Pirate ships are normally always armed and will attack anyone that don't agree with. 
             Often they will attack to take cargo. The Pirates don't care so much about losing some 
             cargo space for the gun mounts on their ships. It is luckily that the Pirates don't have 
             any M1/M2/M6 ships to use!

		<!-- Split                        -->
		<!-- /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ -->

	<h2>Split</h2>
	
	<br>

		<img src="/x2/help/images/logo_split.gif" style="float: left; padding-right: 4px;" alt="Split">
             The split are a warrior race who would rather fight and lose, than to die a coward death. 
             This makes them very wearily of new people visiting their space, and to even dock with one 
             of their station you need to show them a little good will. Their ships also follow the 
             simpler design, where normally split ships have more guns than shielding. However this 
             isn't always true such like the Python, M1 ship where only 17 guns are fitted than the 
             normal 18. On a whole split ships are quite fast, making get to their target quicker than 
             the other species.

	<h2>Teladi</h2>
	
	<br>

		<img src="/x2/help/images/logo_teladi.gif" style="float: left; padding-right: 4px;" alt="Teladi">
             If the Teladi could, they would sell their grandmothers for some profit. Teladi are well 
             known for doing anything if it makes them a profit. One thing that the Teladi do is make 
             ships for the pirates on which they make large profits.
             <br><br>
             Teladi ships however normally have bigger cargo bays for making extra profit, however 
             the Teladi haven't forgot to arm their larger M1/M2/M6 ships with loads of fire-power 
             and shield, however the speed of the ships is generaly lower.

	<h2>Xenon</h2>
	
	<br>

		<img src="/x2/help/images/logo_xenon.gif" style="float: left; padding-right: 4px;" alt="Xenon">

             The Xenon are an product of man's creation which returned on their masters. Xenon's were 
             used to convert planets into livable places for humans to live on. Jumpgates were built 
             to transport human and Xenon ships far across the galaxy. However after some years, the 
             Xenon developed an problem in their programming and they turned on their human masters 
             and a large battle was fort. One captain took it on himself to draw them away from Earth 
             in his ship named 'AP-Sorja 44' aka AP Gunner. So the captian got the Xenon to follow 
             him though an jumpgate and blew it up just after they arrived. This jumpgate was the only 
             gate back to Earth, trapping them in this area of space (the jumpgate can be found in 
             middle of Brennan's Triumph in X2).
             <br><br>
             The captain of the AP Gunner crashed landed. It is 
             believed that the Argon people are descends of that of the Earth people. However much 
             has been forgotten over the years.
             <br><br>
             After the last Xenon war with the Argon - which nearly cost the Argon's their homeland, 
             the Xenon have been losing battles after battles. The biggest blow to the Xenon was the 
             battle being lost by the Xenon in the sector Brennan Triumph were a guy called Brennan 
             destroyed one of the Xenon main ships.
             <br><br>
             Xenon ships are still to this day deadly, so only attack when you have enough firepower.
