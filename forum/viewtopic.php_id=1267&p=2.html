					<span id="post_msg_13006"><div class="quote">Decided to start over with the main campaign, as it became apparent by the middle section that you need a minimum of around 20 million credits to subsidise the cost of building the URV Forge, then the URV Wharf. Actually more like 50 million including upgrades to the Skunk and buying cargo ships, etc. Not enough work in De Vries to come anywhere close to that. Albion space pretty much off limits due to Plutarch hostility, you just get missile spammed or tagged wherever you go and Omicron Lyrae/Maelstrom still not open.<br><br>I reckon it will still be a struggle to earn that much at the outset but as I don&#39;t want to cheat the money in, seems the only way. Economic simulation way off centre, IMHO.<br><cite>- BigVern</cite></div><br><br>I pre-ordered two copies of this game (1 steam, 1 boxed), and was sorely disappointed.  Within the past week or so, I dusted it off and started playing again.  After some game breaking bugs (with ware transfers, etc), I uninstalled, and totally removed any trace of XR on my system.  Then I did a fresh install, and my problems went away!  (Note:  I&#39;m using the Open beta, and all experiences are with Beta 3.6 Beta 3.)<br><br>Spoiler Warning!<br><br>I was able to do the entire campaign without any save edits.  Since I knew what to expect, I tried to get some cash from trading, before I started doing plot stuff, but at some point in the game, you are forced to follow the plot just by flying into a particular zone.  As far as cash flow is concerned, at the point in the plot where you get your ships back, I just sold the Taranis (or whatever the big ship is called), and it yielded me around 30 million credits (on an earlier run, I think I got 60-70 for it).  That and buying all of the scrap metal I could find, then crafting it into Alloys, and selling the Alloys for 550k-680k a pop pretty much funded my campaign.  I also sold the Gigurum freighter you get soon after meeting the Canterans.<br><br>Now that the campaign is over, I&#39;m hoping to help restart the Devries economy, and make my URV Forge self sufficient.  I&#39;ve also taken some station building missions. I fund my activities by capturing and selling PMC Ships.  I use the Marine Rebalance Mod which makes it fun and interesting.<br><br>Unmodded, there are aspects of the game that are still unbearable.  I have a few mods installed to make life a little easier. I don&#39;t know if one of the mods I have caused it, but when I obtained the factory ship to make the plot station, it already had more than enough RMP.  I was able to source everything else from non-PMC stations, and I&#39;ve actually been enjoying the game.  I did use a mod that allows you to purchase Trade Update subscriptions for around 50k-100k each.  That eased a lot of the pain.  I compare it to X3 when I would start every new game by dropping Advanced Satellites in every sector.<br><br>The Captain and Defense Officer AI mod was game breaking, but everything else I used seemed to play nicely.<br><br>Again I&#39;m having a lot of fun with it now.  I purchased a Balor to use as a taxi, and with Litauen&#39;s Capital Ship Bridge mod, it feels a lot more like the game XR should have been from the beginning.<br><br>Sorry for the rambling post.  I originally intended to address the cash flow issues, but it got out of hand. :-)</span>

I wonder how may others would benefit from this step?  I have some performance issues in nebulas, but it isn&#39;t too bad.  During the campaign, it was really only by the Split base (Oh, right, Spoiler Alert.)<br><br>I totally agree about it being over-engineered.  The UI is horrible.  There are way too many steps required to do basic tasks.  This makes it worse when one click is at the top-left corner of the screen, then the next is at the bottom center, and then back to the top-left again.  (I&#39;m not good with kb shortcuts for that stuff.)  Also the sliders to select quantities is horrible.   <br><br>You can assign a trader to a station manager. I guess in a sense, that is an auto-trader (not the kind you want, though). It isn&#39;t anything like the ST&#39;s UT&#39;s of X3.  There are a few mods that try to replicate this, but I haven&#39;t tried them yet.<br><br>I haven&#39;t tried to sell a full load of e-cells, so I cannot speak to that.  I don&#39;t mind the different ware types per freighter, but I do miss the days of parking a freighter at a station and just transferring cargo to it as I see fit.  <br><br>Despite all this I&#39;m still having fun with X Rebirth after getting bored with Elite Dangerous.  Hopefully, now that the game is more playable, we will see more modders come back and make the game better.  I&#39;m a programmer by profession, but I haven&#39;t tried to mod XR (or any other game) yet.  I have a hard time wrapping my brain around how the modding works.  I&#39;m more of a SQL and C# kind of guy.<br></span>

It&#39;s a side effect of apparently buying a ware without knowing there is a demand for it first, which isn&#39;t a Rebirth-specific possibility. Ways of learning about demand in advance include trade agents, station scanning, trade missions and missions with trade info as a reward.</span>

The only exceptions are the unique stations like Badlands Colony (sells ore in Albion but PMC Faction) and the AG Core Dig (in OL, which you may not have access to yet). So even if using a Galaxy Trading Range mod, Managers are probably not able to see any ore to buy at this point in the plot.<br><br>My experience has been mining ships will find ore for the plot Forge OK. Best to use a L Miner though as stations use a System-wide range setting for miners and M Miners tend to get nuked by Reivers once they wonder out of Glaring Truth sector.<br><br><div class="quote"><br>The only drone it purports to produce is not a combat one anyway.<br><cite>- BigVern</cite></div><br>Possibly something you are aware of but the drone production system on the plot station was improved in Rebirth v3.50 beta 2. It was changed from only producing Interceptor Mk Is to cycling between between the following:<br><br>Interceptor Mk I<br>Cargolifter URV<br>Construction URV<br>Scoop Collector Mk I<br>Surface Miner Mk I<br><br><div class="quote"><br>In the meantime, I&#39;m being exhorted to join another battle in my still Mk1 everything Skunk by Borman and Co...<br><cite>- BigVern</cite></div><br>Yes, this is a shame IMO in terms of the URV Forge. I think the plot would make a bit more sense, and the URV Forge would seem more vital to the Canterans, if there was a pause for some drone production. Ideally a plot mission(s) to supply some drones to the shipyard in Darned Hop Air.</span>

I think that the release at that moment was 3.20.<br>After several months being away from the game cause of SWTOR,ED and ofc the bugs, I thought that I should give it one more try. Since then several updates have been released and I thought that the game should be at least a bit better than before and that I wouldn&#39;t start updating XML file (save) again here and thre in order for the plot to continue. I always use 2-3 slots for the save game with a few hours between them incase something bad happens. I was very excited that I was back to game cause I don;t like the graphics of X3Ap at all and the plot was fun. I was happy that after the plot I would setup several stations and I would have fun around selling stuff and doing missions. If I remember right the plot guide has around 43 pages. Everything was so cool till I got to page 8 (I don&#39;t use the guide if I am nost stuck but I want you to understand when my problems started). I was trying to do each step exactly as the quest was asking in order to skip any bug that may still exist at game (LOL my friends, really ...). <br><br>I really can&#39;t described h much frustrating it was to load old saves back and forth (as I said I use 2-3 slots per game) in order for the plot to continue or to make the quest reappear. back on September I don;t really remember having problems at early stages so I can;t really imagine how the game will be at the point where I have to build the station etc. I had problem even to get engineer for the 2nd ship. I am not talking about finding one but to make the game go to next step without the plot mission to disappear.<br><br>I know that some of you already had that feeling and you can really understand how I feel.<br>I tell u the truth I don&#39;t know many ppl who even finished the plot so , in a way, I feel kinda lucky.<br><br>No idea what to do ....<br>Too bad that I can&#39;t play a game that I really like.<br><br>On the contrary X3AP is going very smoothly and without any bug.</span>

					<span id="post_msg_13169">Well I have started over (again) in X-Rebirth. Going for the very slow burn this time which is probably how the campaign was meant to be played but somehow in translation the game encouraged players to rush through. Approach each &#34;mission&#34; as the equivalent of a complete section from the previous games. Do as much scrap metal/haze crafting as you can together with any side missions before moving on to the next plot mission. I find the Junk Dealers stock tends to regenerate once you leave that particular sector (boxes on stations seem to be a one off though), the toughest part is staying clear of the police long enough to craft haze given most of the ingredients are illegal, too.<br><br>Will still probably end up having to alter the save file to generate the forges later on but at least if I go into OL with 300 million credits in the bank I should be able to afford an escort ship or two to take on the final Xenon missions.</span>

					<span id="post_msg_13170">I&#39;ve also went back to X Rebirth after i got bored with Elite: Dangerous(its a good game but once you have everything, there is nothing much to do, then again i&#39;m not a fan of exploration and i usually play solo).<br><br>Lots of good changes to XR. I would say its very much enjoyable now though theres still tons of limitations and loads of room for improvement. I&#39;m starting to get the X3 vibes all over again which is good. Really looking forward to the new patch and expansion.<br><br>Theres been talks about a sequel, i&#39;m both excited but cautious lol. Whether a sequel will happen at all or if its gonna be X4 or XR2, no confirmation yet. Keeping my fingers crossed.</span>

The lack of decent single player/offline ala Elite/Frontier of old and, from what I&#39;ve read, no accelerated travel making journeys in real time. No thanks, if I want to &#34;grind&#34; I&#39;ll amuse myself with Clash Of Clans or Boom Beach on the Android.</span>

					<span id="post_msg_13178">Just a little update - the theory about slow burn was fine, but the game does kind of force the campaign on you. Was toddling around Albion, just started building my first non-plot station when unfortunately I hit the sector with the De Vries jump gate. Not a darn thing I could do to stop the cutscene taking over and next minute I was in de Vries with my unprepared Skunk getting pummeled by Reivers as I tried to get across the system. As the next few elements of the plot follow straight on - the drone hacking etc., just kind of flowing with it until I can break off and catch my breath again.<br><br>As an aside, tell you what&#39;s also annoying - after finishing the first hacker mission (on about attempt No.6) to find the ship computer and Yisha warbling on <i>while about to be fired at by Plutarch</i> but not able to save the game in case the first escape plan doesn&#39;t work.</span>
